            <h2>My name is Isobel Prior but most people call me Izzy. I live in Greystones, Wicklow. I was born in Dublin at 6:12 AM weighing 6 pounds 12 ounces. I lived in Cork, then Dublin, then Kilcoole in Wicklow and now Greysones. I have ginger hair and blue eyes. I live with my mom, dad, two brothers and dog. My spanish student just moved back to Spain after living with me for 5 months, she moved to my house after her other host family didn’t treat her too well. She is one of my best friends and was friends with everyone in Greytones. She made a video on tiktok with a lot of people that lived in the area.<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gadealarrietta/video/7228605837911067930"> tiktok.com/gadealarrietta/video/722860587911067930 </a> </h2>
